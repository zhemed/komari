# Thinking Guides

> **Purpose**: Expand your thinking to catch things you might not have considered.

## Why Thinking Guides?

**Most bugs and tech debt come from "didn't think of that"**, not from lack of skill:

- Didn't think about what happens at layer boundaries → cross-layer bugs
- Didn't think about code patterns repeating → duplicated code everywhere
- Didn't think about edge cases → runtime errors
- Didn't think about future maintainers → unreadable code

These guides help you **ask the right questions before coding**.

## Quick Reference: Thinking Triggers

### When to Think About Cross-Layer Issues

- [ ] Feature touches 3+ layers (API, Service, Component, Database)
- [ ] Data format changes between layers
- [ ] Multiple consumers need the same data
- [ ] You're not sure where to put some logic
- [ ] You are adding an event kind, JSONL record, RPC payload, or config field
- [ ] UI / command code starts casting raw payload fields directly

→ Read [Cross-Layer Thinking Guide](./cross-layer-thinking-guide.md)

### When to Think About Code Reuse

- [ ] You're writing similar code to something that exists
- [ ] You see the same pattern repeated 3+ times
- [ ] You're adding a new field to multiple places
- [ ] **You're modifying any constant or config**
- [ ] **You're creating a new utility/helper function** ← Search first!
- [ ] Two files read the same untyped payload field with local casts
- [ ] Multiple branches update the same derived state from `kind` / `action`

→ Read [Code Reuse Thinking Guide](./code-reuse-thinking-guide.md)

### When Verifying AI Cross-Review Results

- [ ] Reviewer claims "user input can be malicious" → Check the actual data source (internal manifest? user config? external API?)
- [ ] Reviewer flags "missing validation" → Is the data from a trusted internal source?
- [ ] Reviewer says "behavior change" → Read the code comments — is it intentional design?
- [ ] Reviewer identifies a "bug" in test → Mentally delete the feature being tested — does the test still pass? If yes → tautological test

**Common AI reviewer false-positive patterns**:
1. **Trust boundary confusion**: Treating internal data (bundled JSON manifests) as untrusted external input
2. **Ignoring design comments**: Flagging intentional behavior documented in code comments as bugs
3. **Variable misreading**: Not tracing a variable to its actual definition (e.g., Map keyed by path vs name)

**Verification rule**: Every CRITICAL/WARNING finding must be verified against the actual code before prioritizing. Budget ~35% false-positive rate for AI reviews.

## Pre-Modification Rule (CRITICAL)

> **Before changing ANY value, ALWAYS search first!**

```bash
# Search for the value you're about to change
grep -r "value_to_change" .
```

This single habit prevents most "forgot to update X" bugs.

## How to Use This Directory

1. **Before coding**: Skim the relevant thinking guide
2. **During coding**: If something feels repetitive or complex, check the guides
3. **After bugs**: Add new insights to the relevant guide (learn from mistakes)
